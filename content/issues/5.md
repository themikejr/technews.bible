Several exciting things from the month of September: a Bible translation technology report from the field, ChatGPT goes multi-modal, and why manual work is a bug.

But first, what is **TechNews.Bible?**

> TechNews.Bible is intended to be a community resource that enables Bible Translation technologists to discover, learn, share, and collaborate. Read about the backstory and intentions of the newsletter [here](https://technews.bible/about).

## ∴ News

[The _Tech and Testament Podcast_ Launches](https://etenlab.substack.com/p/tech-and-testament-episode-1)  
We have a new outlet for news and information sharing among Bible Translation technologists! This new podcast explores new developments in artificial intelligence and translation technology. The podcast itself is translated into several languages using machine translation and has translated audio produced using text-to-speech technology from [Coqui](https://coqui.ai/). Hosted by Daniel Whitenack at [PredictionGuard](https://www.predictionguard.com/) and presented by the Every Tribe Every Nation Innovation Lab.

[ChatGPT Can Now See, Hear, and Speak](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak)  
Multi-modal interactions are being slowly rolled out to ChatGPT users. "Voice" enables live conversations with language models. "Image" functionality includes not only generating images via DALL-E, but images can also be used as input, the content of which is intelligible to the language model. Reactions online seem to range from "Let's call it HAL and get this over with" to [fairly optimistic](https://x.com/mckaywrigley/status/1707101465922453701). I, for one, am excited to explore the new features in the context of Bible study.

[Technological Insights from Papua New Guinea Field Visit](https://etenlab.substack.com/p/advancing-church-based-bible-translation)  
This is a report from a field visit in Papua New Guinea. The report describes the Church-Based Bible Translation projects in the Milne Bay province of Papua New Guinea. The [AVTT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NvnefcULsbD49N_-4fzr5AVBYzrHHhW2_YK07ZLgzmk) tool is used heavily for the _Familiarization and Internalization_ stage of the process. Many thanks to the [ETEN Innovation Lab](https://etenlab.notion.site/) for sharing this report!

[Manual Work is a Bug](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520)  
This classic article exposits _always be automating_ -- a mindset and technique for technical knowledge work. Written from the perspective of a system administrator, the principles described are widely applicable. The four phases of automation described in the article are probably more relevant to remote work settings today than they were when it was originally written. Highly recommended. From [Thomas Limoncelli](https://twitter.com/yesthattom).

[What is RLHF?](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)  
As exciting developments in generative AI continue, technologists and innovators are bombarded by new terms and acronyms. This article demystifies a concept called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, commonly referred to as RLHF.

## ∴ Upcoming Events

[Bible Translation Conference, Oct 13 - 17](https://btconference.org/)  
The biennial Bible Translation Conference is going back to in-person format in Dallas for the first time since 2019. Historically this conference has been very helpful for me as I've tried to better understand the Bible Translation domain. If you will be at the conference, let's connect!
