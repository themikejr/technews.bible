## 1 :: Dig into AI + LLM technologies

We're in a season where advancements in AI and LLM technologies are happening monthly!
Specialists could easily spend their continuous learning budget on merely keeping up with all of the news, releases, and papers that come out.
For the rest of us, a targeted learning plan might include *following significant developments in the field* and *grasping the fundamentals of these technologies*.

### Keeping up significant developments

- **Try using an LLM in your daily work.** If you aren't already using an LLM alongside your daily work, carve out some time to try using one of these technologies as you work. I've found that often the best way to understand the implications of a technology is to use it. Spend some time with ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, or Google Bard and soon you will have much better grasp at the strenghts and weaknesses of these tools.
- **Strategically follow what's happening.** Twitter can be a huge drain on your time and attention, but it's also where folks are sharing results of their work *LIVE*. Curate a twitter account or list that focuses on interesting AI-related voices and then dedicate 30 minutes a week to check in. Alternatively, there are many helpful newsletters that summarize recent developments on various timescales.

### Grasping fundamentals

- **Understand the big picture**. For example, you might read a book that covers the broad movements of Artifical Intelligence. Lately, I've found [Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans]() to be very helpful. It includes both history and technical explanation of the field.
- **Develop your technical understanding**. Spend some time understand how an LLM works.
