# Managing Your Knowledge Portfolio in 2024

*WORK-IN-PROGRESS DRAFT*

With TechNews.Bible, I wanted to create a new conduit for knowledge sharing that would stoke the fires of innovation and creativity for Bible Translation technologists. As I reflect on the closing of the year, I'm thankful for the interest the community has shown in such a project. In 2023, I have watched the technology industry as a whole and the Bible Translation domain in particular and I am more convinced than ever of the importance of this mission.

In the technology industry, 2023 has been a year of wonder. Technologies that surpass our expectations and spark our imaginations made their way into the marketplace at a blistering pace. In the Bible Translation domain, we have seen potential applications of these technologies. We have also been collaborating in new, innovative ways. 

As we look ahead to 2024, I wanted to share a perspective that has been very influential to me. With effectively limitless opportunities and distractions vying for our attention, a conscious investment of our time and energy is all the more important. In *The Pragmatic Programmer*, the authors outline an approach to managing one's knowledge. They build on the concept of a "knowledge portfolio" that each of us have:

> Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:
> 
> 1. Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.
> 2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.
> 3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments. 
> 4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
> 5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.

While it's easy for some (like me) to overthink this helpful metaphor and spend a bit too much time and energy thinking about my knowledge investments, the general idea is a helpful one. As technologists or innovators working in the Bible Translation domain, we have a certain *responsibility* to invest in the wise development of our knowledge and understanding.

Since the end of the year and the beginning of the next is a time we are often drawn to reflect on our goals, habits, and intentions, below are some ideas for developing your knowledge portfolio in 2024 (and beyond). Unless otherwise stated, the ideas that I share below come from my personal experience -- these are not things merely that happen to sound good or worth doing. I'm sure though there are more wise ideas for learning I don't cover here! If you have an idea borne from experience that you would like to share, I would seriously love for you to [contact me](https://technews.bible/contact) and tell me about it. Now, onto the good stuff!

## 1 :: Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models

Large Language Models are the front and center in technologists' minds right now and for good reason! LLMs and their applications are helping us to be productive and creative in ways that stretch beyond the imagination. AI in general and LLMs in particular are complex -- there is a lot to learn. While a specialist can (and probably should) spend much of their knowledge investment budget on tracking every development, the rest of us will need a targeted learning plan that makes sense for our particular station. I have two primary investment categories for AI and LLMs: *keeping up* and *grasping the fundamentals*.

### Keeping up with significant developments

- **Try using an LLM in your daily work.** If you aren't already using an LLM alongside your daily work, carve out some time to try using one of these technologies as you work. You don't have to adopt it wholesale, but I've often found the best way to understand the implications of a technology is to use it. You could start with ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, or Google Bard. Programmers might try [Github Copilot]() or [Cursor.sh]() if they haven't already. Think about the the challenges and opportunities you face and try crafting a prompt or two that might be able to assist you. Regular use of these tools will yield a much better grasp of their strengths and weaknesses.
- **Strategically follow what's happening.** ~~Twitter~~ X can be a massive drain on your time and attention, but it's also where folks are sharing the results of their work and experimentation with these emerging technologies *as they unfold*. Instead of scrolling for longer than you would like to admit each day, curate a strategically beneficial group of voices to follow related to these technologies. Then, schedule 30 minutes per week to check in and see what's going on. Alternatively, many helpful newsletters can summarize recent developments on various timescales for you.

### Grasping fundamentals

- **Understand the big picture**. One problem I ran into when deciding to invest in AI and LLM knowledge this year was a lack of context. Since I hadn't been following AI closely for the last decade, the emergence of these new tools was surprising and I couldn't trace their historical or technological development. A case like this is where a book can be very helpful for one's knowledge gap. Online posts and articles pale in comparison to books that come from years of experience and focused development. For me,  [Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans]() continues to be very helpful. The book opens with a first hand account of a meeting between Douglas Hofstadter and AI experts at Google. It masterfully weaves together history and technical explanation.
- **Develop your technical understanding**. Arthur C. Clarke famously said "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". The curious technologist in me often needs to have a basic understanding of how a piece of technology works before I can understand and (maybe) trust it. So, like anything else, understanding how it works worth the investment. [Stephen Wolfram's article](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) is one of the best places to start. Audio-visual learners might enjoy [Andrej Carpathy's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g). This [3D Visualization and Walkthough](https://bbycroft.net/llm) is good for clarifying your understanding once you've been exposed to the basics.

## 2 :: Learn some Hebrew or Greek

I admit that I was drawn to our domain becuase of my latent interest in the Bible and the original langugaes it was written in, so I may have an advantage of interest here that others don't. What I know though is that when I joined the domain as a software developer, I was intimitated being surrounded by people who know Hebrew and Greek and often have PhDs in related fields. Moreover, to make a contribution, I needed to be conversant in concepts such as syntax and morphology. These issues pale in comparison to being able to relate to translation teams. I had never needed to translate the Bible, so I was largely ignorant about the difficulties of such tasks and how software tools might help. Getting human feedback in our domain can sometimes be a challenge, so any way we can better related to our users is highly valuable.

When I set out to begin learning Greek, I admittedly had personal interests in mind. What I found though is that learning the grammar of another language and attempting to translate it gave me a new, rich set of experiences through which I could relate to users of our products. I know heartly recommend learning one of the orignal languages to people who desire to make longstanding contributions to our domain. If you aren't ready to take a class, below are some lower levels of knowledge investment that can pay off. I believe that even doing the first one or two of these will bring a return on investment. 

- **Learn the alphabet**. Merely learning the how the letters look and sound moves you from somone who used to see an unintellible string of characters to someone who can recognize letters and words in user interfaces that might involve the original languages. As a programmer, this enabled me to check my work without relying on a Greek or Hebrew expert. I used Duolingo to learn the Greek alphabet.
- **Learn some words**. After you know the alphabet, you can begin memorizing some source/target word pairings. This will enable you to begin to understand simple phrases and sentences. Very soon you will beginning seeing simple examples of what makes translation a very interesting craft. I used [this Greek vocab pack](https://www.biblicalmastery.academy/vocabpack/) to get started.
- **Try to read**. Once you know some words, you may want to begin reading in the language. Try to learn the vocab that will get you through a very simple chapter like 1 John 1, then attempt to read and translate it. When I did this, I was first astonished that I could make anything out, but I quickly realized how little I understood the mechanics of the language. 
- **Learn a bit about how the language works**. At this point, you're going to need to begin understanding the grammar and syntax of the language to make progress. I began exploring grammar's by [Merkle + Plummer](https://a.co/d/aYXwNQQ) and [Black](https://a.co/d/41K7VQd).
- **Take a class!** If you've gotten this far and want to keep going, it's probably best to learn in community from someone who knows what they are talking about. Next year I'm very excited to be (virtually) attending [SeamusU](https://thepatrologist.com/shop/) to continue my greek journey. 


## 3 :: Learn about Translation

I am a firm believer that understanding the perspective of the users one hopes to help is crucial for every member of a technology team. When I started working in Bible Translation, I found it more difficult than expected to understand all that goes into the art of translation -- the full diversity of languages, the complexity of linguistics, cross-cultural team dynamics, the relationships between organizations, the translation process and methodology (both established and emerging) -- all of these were unintuitive and not clearly stated in a document for me to grok. Those who are already multilingual or have a background in linguistics will have a headstart, but I think it's safe to say that we all stand to benefit by better understanding the task at hand and the people we aim to help. Some things that have helped me:

- **Learn about Translation.** When first began in the Bible Translation domain, I was nearly as ignorant as assuming that the best way to translate was something like word substitution. Understanding *why* a view like this is insufficient is crucial. [This podcast series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4qBmdGMhDaFdzk1iA8jcBIdV98Dy08NG) from the *Biblical Languages Podcast* not only includes an episode about translation theory but also has interviews with a wide variety of perspectives on Bible Translation. Listening to the theoretical concepts and the diversity of approaches was instructive for me. Finally, browsing the (SIL's Translation Training Manual for Mother Tongue Translators)[https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/70049] and [unfoldingWord's translationAcademy](https://door43.org/u/Door43/en_ta/eccd2b1a6f/print_all.html) can be very informative.
- **Conferences, Conferences, Conferences**. There is so much that can be absorbed from a conference experience. As I've mentioned in the newsletter, one of the best conferences I've been to for understanding the Bible Translation community is the aptly named [*Bible Translation Conference](https://btconference.org/). Not everyone can attend every conference though. In our organizations, there is usually a team member who spends more time traveling to conferences than others. With a little additional investment, these team members can propagate their learning by doing things like:
Share summaries of their experiences with their teams
Share links to talks and papers that become public after the conference is complete. 
- **Engage your Curiosity** Start with the assumption that you don't have a full understanding of a given aspect of Bible Translation and then whenever you have the chance, ask questions to clarify your understanding. Two types of question-asking tactics that I find beneficial:
When you are with someone with deep domain knowledge, get in the practice of asking about every aspect of the topic at hand, just shy of the point of annoyance! (Within the physical laws of the universe, there is unfortunately a point at which there can be too many questions)
When you think you've arrived at understanding a concept, restate it (verbally or written) and look for opportunities to check your understanding. Asynchronous team-wide communication channels are perfect for this. An effective "prompt" (:wink) might look like "Today I heard ____ talk about ____. I understood them to be saying _____. Am I understanding this correctly? Does anyone else see it a different way?" Messages like this can (a) inform anyone willing to engage and (b) open the door to further clarification and learning.
