# Your Knowledge: An Introduction

*The following article is the first part in a limited series titled **Your Knowledge**. Please [subscribe](/) to receive future installments.*

With TechNews.Bible, I wanted to create a new conduit for knowledge sharing that would stoke the fires of innovation and creativity for Bible Translation technologists. As I reflect on this project's first year, I'm thankful for the interest shown by the community. In 2024, I am more convinced than ever of the importance of this mission.

In the technology industry, 2023 was a year of wonder. Technologies that surpass our expectations and spark our imaginations made their way into the marketplace at a blistering pace. The Bible Translation domain, is seeing real applications of these technologies. We have also been collaborating in new, innovative ways.

As we look ahead to 2024, I wanted to share a perspective that has been very influential to me. While limitless opportunities and distractions vie for our attention, a conscious investment of time and energy is vital. The things we *could* do are legion, but our resources are limited. There is so much to learn, but we are finite. 

While [some may see us moving away from a knowledge economy soon](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-knowledge-economy-is-over-welcome-to-the-allocation-economy), I still find "knowledge" to be a helpful organizing concept for my endeavor to learn and grow. But what is knowledge?

In the information science literature, there is a model which has endured. No one seems sure where it came from, but everyone has their take on it. The Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom (DIKW) Hierarchy imagines the its elements as layers that build upon one another, each being of a higher order than the next. Data are phenomena in the world -- stimuli, signs, signals, symbols, and instances of fact. Information is data "endowed with meaning and purpose." Information brings narrative, structure, and intention to data. Knowledge is the embodiment of information, with layers of contextual lived experience. And wisdom? Wisdom is knowledge employed by mastery, infused with the pursuit of *why*.

Our knowledge gives shape to the contributions we make to our field and community. So why not approach the management and development of it with intention? I once encountered an expression of such intention that had a formative influence on me. In *[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)*, the authors outline an approach to managing one's knowledge. They think of knowledge in terms of investment. They build on the concept of a **knowledge portfolio**:

> Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:
> 
> 1. Serious investors invest regularlyâ€”as a habit.
> 2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.
> 3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments. 
> 4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
> 5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.

Your knowledge as a portfolio. What should you invest in? What has given you good returns on your investment? What is your appetite for risk? How can you achieve balance? Wisdom calls out to us. How will we answer her?

It's far too easy for me to overthink this helpful metaphor, thinking about my knowledge investments more than I spend time investing and working for the good of those around me. In any case, I expect the idea will be useful to most (and if you have the same pitfalls as I do, my condolences, be sure to [drop me a line](/contact)). As technologists or innovators working in the Bible Translation domain, we have a responsibility to invest in the wise development of our knowledge and skills.

The remainder of this limited series will look at areas for investment and strategies for doing it wisely. We'll look at bleeding-edge technology, learning languages, and more. Unless otherwise stated, these areas and strategies come from my personal experience. The world doesn't need more blog posts where people advise others merely because it sounds good.

I'm sure there are many wise ideas I won't cover here. If you have an idea (borne from experience) that you would like to share, I would seriously love for you to [contact me](/contact) and tell me about it. Onward!
